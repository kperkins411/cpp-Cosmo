# cpp-Cosmo
##An ASCII art project.  

This codebase is a starter C++ assignment that I created a few years back.  Most of the code for an interactive ASCII art style game is given.  
Here is a screenshot of the intro:

And here is one where the game is being played.  The games keeps track of the number of balloons Cosmo pops as well as the number of times Cosmo is hit by an Anvil.
